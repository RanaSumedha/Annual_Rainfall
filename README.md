# Annual_Rainfall
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning–based analysis and prediction of annual rainfall across Indian meteorological sub-divisions using historical data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD).
The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data science workflow, including data preprocessing, outlier detection, supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and visualization.
🎯 Objectives
Analyze historical rainfall data across Indian regions
Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
Detect and remove outliers using the IQR method
Apply regression models to predict annual rainfal
Classify regions into high and low rainfall categories
Cluster regions based on rainfall patterns
Visualize insights using plots and heatmaps
